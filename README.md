# Immortalityidle

Immortality Idle is an idle game based on the tradition of cultivation stories. You play as a cultivator seeking immortality across multiple lifetimes, continually progressing with each reincarnation. Most of the game logic is contained in the services located in the game-state folder, the rest of the source folders contain the html, javascript, and styles that create the game's user interface.

This game is open source, so use the code as much as you want. Please keep anything you derive from this code open as well.

This project is a standard Angular application, so just search for a tutorial for how to set up npm and angular if you want to get started doing development. Once you are set up, use "ng serve" to run locally, "npm run build" to create deployables.
