# Immortalityidle

Immortality Idle is an idle game based on the tradition of Chinese cultivation stories. You play as a cultivator seeking immortality across multiple lifetimes, continually progressing with each reincarnation. Most of the game logic is contained in the services located in the game-state folder, the rest of the source folders contain the html, javascript, and styles that create the game's user interface.

This game is open source, so use the code as much as you want. Please keep anything you derive from this code open as well.

This project was generated with Angular version 13.3.3. Use "ng serve" to run locally, "npm run build" to create deployables.
