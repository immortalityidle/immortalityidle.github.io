    <span>Ascension techniques are powerful steps that can permanently increase your potential. Be warned: after ascending, you will find yourself temporarily weakened and vulnerable to all sorts of threats. Wise sages have warned that you may even need to seek more humble dwellings and avoid stronger monsters until you have regained your full strength.</span>
