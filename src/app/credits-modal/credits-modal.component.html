                Hi! My name is Christian Bradley, and I made this game for you. I write boring old regular software by day, but by night I write sci-fi and fantasy novels and create this cultivation idle game.

                Everything involved in this project (the game, the code, the art, and the music) is all open source and free.

                The code for the game is hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/immortalityidle/immortalityidle.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>, and they also host the playable game.
